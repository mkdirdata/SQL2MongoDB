# SQL2MongoDB

<br>
<hr>

Idea is to create a Pipeline to transfer data from regular SQL datbases to MongoDB.
Currently only handles SQLite.
However there's some redundant, or lets say unnecesary code, will remove in future.
(some sections of Datapipline, as this can be handeled through pd.read_sql_table, pd.read_sql_query, pd.read_sql)
