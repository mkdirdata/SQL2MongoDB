# SQL2MongoDB

<br>
Idea is to create a Pipeline to transfer data from regular SQL datbases to MongoDB.
<hr>
Currently only handles SQLite.<br>
However there's some redundant, or lets say unnecesary code, will remove in future.<br>
(some sections of Datapipline, as this can be handeled through pd.read_sql_table, pd.read_sql_query, pd.read_sql)
